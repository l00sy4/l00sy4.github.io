I'm a pure math student with a great interest in penetration testing, malware development and red team ops. Although currently pursuing the CPTS certification, I have no other "formal" education and most information you will find on this blog are the result of self study.

In this blog you will find CTF writeups, the results of red teaming experiments, and everything about malware development: evasion, persistence, testing, etc.

Any tools that I will create in the context of this blog will be available on my public GitHub.
