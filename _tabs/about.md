I'm a pure math student with a passion for malware development and red team ops.

In this blog you will find my experiments with malware, results of various labs, CTF writeups and whatever I consider interesting enough to write a post about.
Most information you will find here are the result of self study and learning from other people.

Any tools that I will create in the context of this blog will be available on my public GitHub.
