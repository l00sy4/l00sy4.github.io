I'm a pure math student with a passion for malware development and red team ops. I have no certifications and most information you will find on this blog are the result of self study and learning from other people.

In this blog you will find my experiments with malware, results of various labs, CTF writeups and whatever I consider interesting enough to write a post about.

Any tools that I will create in the context of this blog will be available on my public GitHub.
