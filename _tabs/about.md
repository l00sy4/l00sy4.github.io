I'm a pure math student with a passion for malware development and red team ops. Although currently pursuing the CPTS certification, I have no other "formal" education and most information you will find on this blog are the result of self study and learning from other people.

In this blog you will find my experiments with malware, red team labs and occasionally CTF writeups.

Any tools that I will create in the context of this blog will be available on my public GitHub. Everything in here is for educational purposes only.
