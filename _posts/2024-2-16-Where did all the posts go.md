So you may be wondering why most of my posts have disappeared. Lately I have been, frankly, all over the place. 

After some reflection, I have decided that I want to take this blog in a different direction and improve the quality of my work. To achieve this, I have made a plan to fix my shaky foundation. I will:

- Learn C for my implant
- Learn C++ when I eventually get into driver development and rootkits
- Learn Go for my C2
- Read the Windows internals books

This means I won't be posting for a while, but you can find all deleted posts in an [archive](https://github.com/l00sy4/blog-related-projects)
